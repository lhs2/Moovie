This project is a challenge that I received to do in 4 days, but unfortunately I couldnâ€™t be able to do the all features because I donâ€™t have a MacBook and these days I was very busy with my companyâ€™s project.
Even this app doesnâ€™t contain all features, I did the best I could and Iâ€™m satisfied with the final result. Hope youâ€™ll enjoy it.

Design Pattern: MVP
API: Manager with Alamofire
